# diceRoller

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of diceRoller is to simulate rolling dice. You choose the size (or number of faces) of the die, the number of dice to be rolled, and, if you roll several dice, whether to add them all together or get the mean, max and min (in that order) of the dice rolled.

## Installation

You can install the development version of diceRoller from [GitHub](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-bperkinsj) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-bperkinsj")
```

## Example
Behind you, rushing down the hill, are kobolds with murder in their eyes and very sharp, possibly torturous, tools in their hands. Before you is a gaping chasm with only a spindly rope bridge spanning it. Below, water thunders through the rift. Roll me 1d20 to see how well you can carefully and deftly cross the bridge. 
```{r}
library(diceRoller)
dice_roller(20)
```

Pretty good! Or terrible! But turns out it doesn't matter what you rolled, the bridge was going to collapse regardless, sending you plummeting into the rapids! And no, you can't reach out and grasp a nearby tree branch or rock ledge because you have no choice in this adventure. Choice is an illusion anyway.

Let's roll damage!
```{r}
dice_roller(6, 4)
```

That's a lot of damage! But I forgot to mention, if you roll a 6 on one of these dice, the die explodes and you roll another d6! Let's see if you roll any sixes here.
```{r}
dice_roller(6, 4, FALSE)
```
You got lucky today. Or as lucky as you can be hurtling down rapids.

What's that? This adventure is bull****? Hey, I didn't write it. Okay, I did, but what're you gonna do about it, huh? Just try to re-write reality, why don't you. Roll some negative dice.
```{r}
dice_roller(0)
```
See? I thought not.


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
